PLATFORMS
Primary taregt is Windows 7 64bit, should theoretically compile on XP, haven't tried.
On Windows I compile with MinGW64 / GCC 8.1.0 / POSIX threads.

Linux (Debian stretch) support is planned.
On Debian I compile with GCC 8.1.0.

DEPENDENCIES
FreeGLUT (bundled, not working under Linux atm, to be removed).

BUILDING
I do full builds with:
make clean ; make

Set switches (DBG, OPT, etc) in Makefile.
